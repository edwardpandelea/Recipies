    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a carnival favorite where I grew up. Oreos get dipped into pancake batter and fried - yummy!! You can do this with or without a deep fryer.</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="listOfRecipies Steps">
        <li>Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Whisk together the egg, milk, and 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a bowl until smooth. Stir in the pancake mix until no dry lumps remain. Dip the cookies into the batter one at a time, and carefully place into the hot frying oil. Fry only 4 or 5 at a time to avoid overcrowding the deep fryer. Cook until the cookies are golden-brown, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving.</li>
